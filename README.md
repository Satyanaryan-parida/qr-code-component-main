## üß© Overview

This project is a QR Code Component built to practice HTML, CSS, and Flexbox.  
It displays a QR code with a card layout and descriptive text in a clean, responsive design.

**Key Features:**
- Fully responsive card layout
- Flexbox-based vertical centering
- Semantic HTML and reusable CSS variables

**Goal:** To strengthen my understanding of Flexbox, responsive design, and clean UI layout while building a realistic component.

## üß† My Process

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS custom properties** for maintainable colors
- **Flexbox** for alignment and layout
- **Mobile-first workflow**
- **Responsive design principles**

### What I Learned

This challenge helped me strengthen my understanding of:

- Centering elements with Flexbox using `justify-content` and `align-items`
- Creating reusable color variables with `:root`
- Maintaining consistent spacing and typography with relative units and `gap`

Here‚Äôs a snippet I‚Äôm proud of:

```css
body {
  background-color: var(--Slate-300);
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
````

This ensures the `.card` component stays perfectly centered on all screen sizes.

### Continued Development

In the future, I want to:

* Explore CSS Grid for layout-based projects
* Add subtle animations (like fade-in effects) to enhance interactivity
* Focus more on accessibility (alt text, semantic tags, and color contrast)
