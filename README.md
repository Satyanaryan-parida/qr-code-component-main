## üß† My Process

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5** markup  
- **CSS custom properties** for maintainable color scheme  
- **Flexbox** for alignment and layout  
- Mobile-first workflow  
- Responsive design principles  

### What I Learned

This challenge enhanced my skills in:  

- Centering elements using Flexbox with `justify-content` and `align-items`  
- Creating reusable color variables using `:root`  
- Maintaining consistent spacing and typography with relative units and `gap`

Here‚Äôs a CSS snippet I‚Äôm proud of:

```
body {
  background-color: var(--Slate-300);
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

This snippet ensures the `.card` component is perfectly centered across all screen sizes.

### Continued Development

Future goals include:  

- Exploring CSS Grid for advanced layouts  
- Adding subtle animations like fade-ins to boost interactivity  
- Increasing focus on accessibility, including alt text, semantic tags, and color contrast
